                Over time, it became clear, that outdated equipment and the approach of higher-level managers will not allow to develop fully.
                In this regard, the main goal at the moment is to <strong>change the field of activity</strong>. I was attracted to the field of IT by the fact that the knowledge and experience gained can 
                be fully applied and at the same time constantly improved.
                    My strengths include communication skills, and the ability to understand how everything works, thereby performing tasks with understanding, and not according to a template.
                    The description is brief, so that's it. </div>

                    As a result, the first 3-4 days were hard, knowledge returned, but by the end of the rest, you could have a conversation with other vacationers. </div>
