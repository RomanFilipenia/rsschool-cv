 3)	Graduated full-time from "БРУ" with a degree in "ПТСДМиО" in 2013. By distribution, started my career at ЗАО "МКСИ" as a master of equipment repair.
 Over time, it became clear, that outdated equipment and the approach of higher-level managers will not allow to develop fully.
 In this regard, the main goal at the moment is to ***change the field of activity***. I was attracted to the field of IT by the fact that the knowledge and experience gained can be fully applied and at the same time constantly improved.
##	My strengths include *communication skills*, and the **ability to understand how everything works**, thereby performing tasks with understanding, and not according to a template.
	The description is brief, so that's it.

7) The Level of knowledge of English leaves much to be desired. From the experience of speaking: a trip to a country where there was no population with knowledge of russian for 2 weeks.
As a result, the first 3-4 days were hard, knowledge returned, but by the end of the rest, you could have a conversation with other vacationers.
